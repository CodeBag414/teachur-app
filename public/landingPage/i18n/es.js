    "section3.students.p1": "To earn a degree on Teachur requires the same level of mastery as a degree at a traditional university. In order to find the requirements for your degree, log on to Teachur, and select a degree. Within the degree, you’ll see all the objectives you need to master. If you feel you have mastered them, or some portion of them, you can move right to the assessment phase. If not, we can point you to some resources to help you master them.",
    "section3.students.p2": "Free Learning for Everyone!",
    "section3.students.p3": "We’ll be offering our degrees for $1000, but the learning pathways, or series of objectives for a degree on Teachur will be free and open to everyone. You only pay if you want to take a verified assessment. ",
    "section3.teachers.title": "How Does it Work?",
    "section3.teachers.subtitle": "Objectives, lessons, courses and degrees ... sound familiar?",
    "section3.teachers.p1": "A college degree amounts to a set of objectives with which you have demonstrated mastery. Objectives can fall under affective (emotion/feeling), cognitive (thinking), or psychomotor (physical/kinesthetic) domains, and they can be wide-ranging or laser focused. Helping you get clarity on these objectives is at the heart of Teachur. We help you write clear, robust objectives with explicit outcomes and suitable assessments. You can also look through our community created database to find examples to get you started.", 
    "section3.teachers.p2": "But Teachur isn't only about building objectives. Teachur helps you organize your objectives into lessons, your lessons into courses and even your courses into their own aligned degrees. Never before have learning paths been so clear and comprehensive. Get started building and sharing world-class objectives, lessons, and courses today. ",
    "section3.edtech.subtitle": "Blockchain-ed Assessments",
    "section3.edtech.description": "A major innovation for education: verification through the Blockchain",
    "section3.edtech.p1": "To confirm that a student has mastered material, we are tying our assessments, and therefore mastery of each objective, to the Blockchain. If you’re not familiar, the Blockchain is more secure than the standards for awarding degrees in conventional universities. It’s near impossible to hack, and the consequences of trying to game the Blockchain are much more severe and long-lasting than conventional systems.This is unprecedented in academic settings. With Teachur, for the first time, students will have a public record that confirms not just that they have earned a degree, but exactly what information and competencies they have mastered.",
    "section3.edtech.p2": "This means that our degrees will be a step up in terms of security, legitimacy, and usefulness compared to those from conventional schools. Not only will students receive a transcript that lists their courses and grades, they will have a public record of discrete topics and skills they have mastered along the way. This piece could have a larger impact on education than anything else we’ve seen in a while. It’s a key differentiator for Teachur.",
    "section3.edtech.p3": "<b>Wow! We Want to Use the Blockchain for our students too!</b>",
    "section3.edtech.p4": "Great news! We’ll also be making this technology available to schools and groups, from K-12, to Higher Ed, to private sector groups interested in verified online assessments. We believe this option offers a compelling alternative to testing centers and in-person proctors. The process is straightforward, secure, and much more convenient than visiting a testing center. Beyond the convenience, after each assessment, students and their sponsoring institution will receive a link to the public record displaying what topics and skills students have mastered. And the steps to import your materials onto our platform and enjoy these benefits are simple and secure as well. Sound interesting? We’d love to discuss this further!",

We created our templates to deliver the clearest path to master lesson or course objectives, and to optimize the possibilities for finding relevant materials, and collaborating with others across the hall, campus, or world. Even if you have no educational background or are new to teaching or instructional design, you’ll find with our templates it’s easy to build world-class curriculum.",

More recently I have worked in public higher education where I have seen the good and the bad of the modern education landscape.",

I spent several years teaching courses in foundations of education at the college level, and spent much of the last 20 years evaluating, developing, and aligning curriculum across a range of disciplines, including five years as Director of specialized curriculum with K12.com, a leading provider of online education.",
    "section5.p1": "Teachur was created because it was a tool that we wanted to use. Having worked in higher ed for the past 15 years, we saw the need for something that would not only cut down on the time it took to design course content, but also improve the quality.",
    "section5.p2": " As we worked on developing the Teachur platform, we found we could build lessons, courses, and degrees in hours or days instead of months. This led us to a realization that the exorbitant cost at universities were not reflective of the degree curriculum, but rather, some other costs. We decided to find out how much it would cost to build a stripped down degree program comparable to the essential objectives at other universities, but built on our platform optimized for this, and delivered and assessed online.",
    "section5.p3": "Our research took us all over the place, and ultimately settled around $1000. $1000 for a bachelor's degree!? This can’t be real! Then why are universities charging $120,000? We couldn't believe it either, but now we're thrilled to share Teachur with the world. Learn more about the process of building a degree on Teachur.",
